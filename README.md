# Algorithms Repository

## Description
This repository is a collection of foundational algorithms used in computer science. These algorithms provide the basis for understanding more complex computational techniques and structures.

## Contents

1. BST: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
2. Heap Algorithms: Data structure based algorithms, primarily used for priority queue implementations.
3. Runtime Comparisons: Scripts and tools to compare the runtime of different algorithms under varying conditions.
4. Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
5. Peak Finder: Algorithm to find a peak element in a dataset. A peak is defined as an element which is greater than or equal to its neighbors.

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its respective directory. Navigate to the directory of interest and follow the usage instructions provided in the specific README for that algorithm.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have requirements.txt installed.
