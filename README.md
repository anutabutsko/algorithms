# Algorithms Repository

## Description
This repository is a collection of foundational algorithms used in computer science. These algorithms provide the basis for understanding more complex computational techniques and structures.

## Contents

1. BST: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
2. Heap Algorithms: Data structure based algorithms, primarily used for priority queue implementations.
3. Runtime Comparisons: Scripts and tools to compare the runtime of different algorithms under varying conditions.
4. Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
5. Peak Finder: Algorithm to find a peak element in a dataset. A peak is defined as an element which is greater than or equal to its neighbors.
6. Hash Table: Data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides efficient retrieval of values based on their associated keys. It uses a hash function to compute an index, from which the desired value can be found.
7. Shortest Path Algorithm: Demonstrates how to find the shortest paths in a graph using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

## Usage
