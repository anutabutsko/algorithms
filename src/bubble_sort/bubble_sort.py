"""
The following algorithm takes in an unsorted list and iterates
through every element of the list using a nested loop structure:
the outer loop selects an element and the inner loop compares
this element with every following element in the list.
If the selected element is larger than any of the elements
that follow it, these two elements are passed to the Swap()
function, which swaps their positions, gradually sorting
the list from smallest to largest. This sorting method is known
as "Bubble Sort". Its time complexity is generally represented
as T(n) = O(nÂ²), which can be inferred from the two nested loops
in the algorithm.

"""
From the generated plot, it is evident that the curve increasingly
assumes a quadratic(n^2) nature as the size of the input n grows.
This illustrates the algorithm's quadratic time complexity, meaning
that the runtime increases quadratically as the number of elements
in the list increases.
