## Introduction
Given scripts provide various algorithms for identifying peaks in one-dimensional lists and two-dimensional matrices. Peaks are elements greater than or equal to their neighbors.

## Dependencies
- `numpy` for matrix operations and generating random arrays
- `timeit` for measuring function execution times

## Functions

### 1. `validate(lst: List) -> Union[str, int, bool]`
Checks if a list is empty or has only one element:
- Returns `'List is empty.'` for empty lists.
- Returns the single element for lists of size 1.
- Otherwise, returns `False`.

### 2. `peak_finder_2(lst: List[int]) -> str`
Identifies a peak in a one-dimensional list using a linear search approach. It goes through the list until it finds a peak, marking elements greater than their predecessor:
- Time Complexity: \(O(n)\)
- The output includes the peak and the execution time.

### 3. `peak_finder_3(lst: List[int]) -> str`
Utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to find a peak in a one-dimensional list. The list is divided in half, and comparisons are made to determine the side where the peak might exist:
- Time Complexity: \(O(\log n)\)
- The output includes the peak and the execution time.

### 4. `peak_finder_22(lst: Union[List[int], List[List[int]]]) -> str`
Finds a peak in a one-dimensional list or a two-dimensional matrix. In the latter scenario, every row and column is inspected until a peak is identified:
- Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\) for matrices.
- The output includes the peak and the execution time.

### 5. `peak_finder_23(lst: Union[List[int], List[List[int]]]) -> str`
Determines a peak either in a one-dimensional list or a two-dimensional matrix. For matrices, the approach involves splitting the matrix by columns and recursively identifying the largest value:
- Time Complexity: \(O(n \log n)\) for matrices.
- The output includes the peak and the execution time.

## Usage

Sample data is provided in the script for testing purposes:
- `lst_1dim`: A one-dimensional list of 1,000,000 unique numbers.
- `lst_2dim`: A two-dimensional matrix of size 1000x1000 with unique numbers.

To obtain worst-case running time visualizations:
- `lst_1dim2`: A list of integers in increasing order.
- `lst_2dim2`: A two-dimensional array with rows of increasing numbers.

To run the algorithms on the sample data, simply execute the script. Results will be printed, showcasing the identified peak and the time taken for each algorithm.

## Conclusion
These peak finder algorithms offer diverse strategies for tackling the problem of identifying peak elements in different data structures. Their performance can vary based on the input size and distribution. Testing them on provided sample data gives insights into their efficiency and behavior.
