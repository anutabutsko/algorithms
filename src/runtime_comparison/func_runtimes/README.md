# Runtime Comparison Functions

## Introduction
Provided scripts demonstrates a visual comparison of different runtime functions using Python. These functions represent typical runtime complexities that algorithms may possess, such as linear, logarithmic, and exponential time complexities. The script makes use of the `matplotlib` library to visualize these runtime complexities on a plot.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`: Used for creating arrays and performing vectorized mathematical operations.
- `matplotlib`: Required for plotting the functions.

## Usage
Execute the script to visualize the growth of the different functions. The x-axis (`n`) represents the input size while the y-axis (`f(n)`) represents the runtime complexity or function value.

The graph will showcase how each function grows concerning the input, helping visualize which functions represent efficient algorithms (i.e., grow slower) and which ones are less efficient (i.e., grow faster).

## Conclusion
Visualizing the runtime of algorithms can provide insights into their efficiency and behavior concerning the input size. This script is a tool to understand and compare the complexities of different algorithms at a glance. Using such visualizations can aid in algorithm analysis, helping developers and researchers choose the most efficient approach for a given problem.
